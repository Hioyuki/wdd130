            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="text-image-container">
                <p>The history of "white water rafting" dates back to the early 20th century, evolving from leisurely river exploration to an exhilarating outdoor activity set amidst nature's flowing waters.
                    Throughout ancient times, rivers have been explored and utilized as a means of water transportation. However, the establishment of white water rafting as a full-fledged sport began primarily in the western United States.</p>

                <p>During the 1930s and 1940s, rafting gained popularity as an adventurous pursuit, particularly along renowned white water rivers such as the Colorado and Arkansas Rivers. Adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts flocked to these rivers to enjoy this new sport.
                    By the 1950s, rafting started to be recognized as a more mainstream activity. Tour guides and outfitters began businesses, catering to a wide range of individuals from beginners to experienced rafters.</p>
